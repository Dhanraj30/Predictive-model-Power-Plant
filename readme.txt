The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant 
over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load.
Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), 
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy 
output (EP)  of the plant.
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and 
heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam 
turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another.
While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the 
ambient variables effect the GT performance.
For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be 
carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried
out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.

Attribute Information:

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables 
- Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C,
- Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar,
- Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16%
- Exhaust Vacuum (V) in the range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg
- Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW
The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant that record the ambient 
variables every second. The variables are given without normalization.

You are given:
1. A Readme file for more details on dataset. 
2. A Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data
3. A X test File and you have to predict and submit predictions for this file.
Your task is to:
1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
-
1. Use Gradient Descent as a training algorithm and submit results predicted.
2. Files are in csv format, you can use genfromtxt function in numpy to load data from csv file. Similarly you can use savetxt function to save data into a file.
3. Submit a csv file with only predictions for X test data. File should not have any headers and should only have one column i.e. predictions. Also predictions shouldn't be in exponential form.
4. Your score is based on coefficient of determination. So it can be possible that nobody gets full score.
